Bug reports
-----------

First, make sure the bug is in Asar, not the patch you are applying. When you
are sure that the problem is in Asar:

Asar's issue tracking is at https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar/issues . If you
find a bug, please first check that the issue hasn't been reported yet, and then
create a new issue, detailing what happens, what you expected to happen, and the
patch you are trying to apply.

If you don't have a GitHub account, you can also tell someone about the bug on
Discord (in the #asm channel) or the SMW Central forums (in Asar's thread,
https://smwc.me/t/51349 ).
